# Credit_management
A simple dynamic website that is used to manage transfer of credits between multiple users by using simple web designing technologies like HTML, CSS, PHP, MYSQL. ( Credit is sort of points which can be transferred from one user to another. ) Each user having its own id and name is supposed to select their name from the table in users.php to view their previous transactions and to transfer money to other users in transaction.php . Then sender then fills appropriate details of the receiver and the amount(credits) to be transferred in transaction.php . The transaction is successfull if it satisfies all the contraints like : a sender cannot transfer money to itself, the receiver should be present in the users table ( given in users.php) and the minimum balance in senders account should be 100. If constraints are not satisfied then the transaction fails. In either case, user will be directed to users.php . If the transaction is successful then all the corresponding details are successfully updated in users.php .
